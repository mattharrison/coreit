coreit
-------

Helper function to throw code on cores that can be run in parallel.

If you have code like

>>> for i in xrange(start, stop):
...     slow_function(i)

You can speed it up on a 4-core machine by running it like so:

>>> functions = [slow_function for i in xrange(start, stop)]
>>> args = [(i,) for i in xrange(start, stop)]
>>> coreit(functions, args, 4)

Requirements
-------------

* multiprocessing  (python 2.6 or http://code.google.com/p/python-multiprocessing/)
